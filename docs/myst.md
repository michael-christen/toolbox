# MyST

Great news, we don't have to use .rst, we can leverage
[MyST](https://mystmd.org/) to write markdown.

MyST makes Markdown more _extensible_ & **powerful** to support an ecosystem of
tools for computational narratives, technical documentation, and open scientific
communication.

:::{important} Our Values We believe in a community-driven approach of
open-source tools that are composable and extensible. :::
