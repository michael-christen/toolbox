# toolbox

My personal monorepo.

This will include everything from one-off scripts and experiments to libraries
and applications. I'll likely mostly use Python, C++, and Rust (fingers
crossed) and tie it all into 1 build tool to bring them all together.

This should act as a repository of projects I'm working on and an example of my
latest insights into best practices, design principles, dev-ops usage, etc.

- tools: directory of various tools
- experiments: miscellaneous experiments I'm trying out
