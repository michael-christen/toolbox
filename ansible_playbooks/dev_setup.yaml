# Run remotely to configure a new machine in a minimalist manner.
# Main Purposes:
#   - Installing core packages
#   - Bootstrapping shared config (git directory that sets up links)
# Thoughts?
# -
#  remote_user: "{{ lookup('env', 'USER') }}"
#  become_flags: "--preserve-env=SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
#  vars:
#    ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
# - how do we bootstrap the first little bit, eg) setup a ssh server?
# - how to keep these separate? maybe different roles that are linked here?
#
# Notes from setup.md:
# - Document installation
# - Get monorepo going
#
# Other stuff to do?
# - ssh-keygen
# - Download and install chrome
# sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
# - See https://www.one-tab.com/page/mlxlfXwBR0Wvji536ANM7w too
# - Need instructions as well, to setup router as well
# - Configure bazelisk
# wget -O ~/tools/bazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.18.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64
# chmod +x ~/tools/bazel
# ~/tools/bazel
# Add to path
#
# sensors command to check hardware
# - lm-sensors
#
# - check versions of packages?
